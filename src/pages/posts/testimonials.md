In various projects, Taylor's knack for communication becomes evident, making the process not only efficient but also enjoyable.

”I had the pleasure of working with Taylor at Bonjoro where she helped the company scale to our first $2M in revenue. In the chaotic environment of an early stage startup, she brought a level of stillness and composure that enabled her to stay focused, providing her space to understand costumer problems, and meet them with innovative, product-led solutions. 

Within the team, she prioritized inclusivity and actively created a collaborative work environment-qualities that enabled us to scale both the business and the team efficiently.”
