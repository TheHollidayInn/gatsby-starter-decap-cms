### Origin Story

I'm an Oklahoman, born and raised amidst the rich tapestry of tribal nations, onion burgers, and the spirit of country music. My heritage is a blend of Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, and settler roots, and I proudly belong to the Chickasaw Nation. Growing up near my Nation's capital instilled in me a profound love for my culture and community. I cherish the memories of horse riding, fishing, Friday night football games, and savoring fry bread. My passion lies in serving Indigenous peoples through both my professional and volunteer endeavors.

### Professional

My professional passion is to serve Indigenous and underrepresented communities. I am a dedicated professional with a strong background in program management and a deep commitment to advancing Indigenous rights and environmental justice. With a proven track record of securing grants and building strategic partnerships, I have successfully administered significant grants, overseen projects, and managed teams, ensuring positive outcomes within set timelines. My passion for renewable energy and environmental conservation aligns with my extensive experience in grant development, fundraising, and project management, making me a valuable asset in advancing economic and environmental justice. I am committed to leveraging my skills to drive positive change in tribal communities and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the renewable energy sector. I want to help make the world a better place. 

### Personal

In my leisure time, I cherish moments with my partner, Keith Holliday, and our son, Miko (meaning 'Leader' in Chickasaw). While I fondly recall the plains of Oklahoma, I've grown to adore the majestic Rocky Mountains surrounding our home in Longmont, Colorado. Running alongside these breathtaking peaks with my rescue dog, Aponi, is a cherished pastime. I'm an avid reader of fiction, and count Stephen Graham Jones as one of my favorite authors. Additionally, sewing my own clothing and enjoying leisurely mornings at a local coffee shop are among my treasured hobbies.
