### Origin Story

I was born and raised in Oklahoma. Home of many tribal nations, the onion burger, Reba McIntyre, and the University of Oklahoma (Boomer Sooner!). My family is made up of Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, and settler blood. I am an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation and grew up down the street from my Nation’s capital building. Like many Oklahomans, especially those from Tishomingo, I grew up horse riding, fishing, going to Friday night football games, and eating way too much fry bread. Growing up on the Chickasaw Nation reservation instilled a deep respect and love for my tribal nation and our culture. Because of this love and respect, my passion in life is serving other Indigenous peoples’ in my work and volunteer opportunities. 

### Professional 

My professional passion is to serve Indigenous and underrepresented communities. 

### Personal

When I’m not working, I am usually spending time with my partner, Keith Holliday, and our son Miko (which means “Leader” in Chickasaw). Though I miss the plains of Oklahoma, I love living next to the beautiful Rocky Mountains in Longmont, Colorado. With such beautiful scenery, running with my dog Aponi next to the mountains is one of my favorite past times. I also love reading, especially fiction, I am a huge Stephen Graham Jones fan. I also love sewing my own clothes and spending lazy mornings at a local coffee shop.
